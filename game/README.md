# Team-shuffler


## usage

 setup the project resources
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/bravian1/Team-shuffler.git
 cd Team-shuffler
 chmod 755 setup.sh
 ./setup.sh
```

run the code

```bash
 go run .
```

## port issues

If you run the code and it exits immediately, chances are that you are using a port that is already being used.

You can change the project configuration inside the root folder's config.json. For example
- app name
- port

Note: the host name can only be changed when pushin to production
